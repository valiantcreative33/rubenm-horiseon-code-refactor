# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge

# Synopsis
An HTML/CSS/Git challenge project to improve the codebase. My aim for this project was to take existing code that was created for a marketing agency landing page and refactor (which is to improve the code without changing its functionality) it to improve accessibility. Refactoring the code also involved consolidating the HTML and CSS to avoid repetitive code to make it more concise and easier to read.
